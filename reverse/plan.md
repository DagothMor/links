## Plan for Reverse Engineer from https://twitter.com/daeken

1) Read: Reversing by Eldad Eilam
2) Skip if you already know assembly
2a) Do: Write some C, compile it, disassemble, hand-decompile to C
2b) Do: Have a friend write and compile some C, then disassemble and hand-decompile it and have friend check your work [...]
3) Do: Pick a game.  Reverse-engineer its archive format and write an unpacker
4) Do: Reverse-engineer the 3d model format for a game
5) Read: The Dragon Book (Compilers by Aho et al) [...]
6) Do: Write a compiler from some high-level language (feel free to make one up) to another (good candidates: JavaScript, Python, Ruby)
7) Do: Write an assembler
8) Do: Write a compiler from some language down to assembly
9) Read: Reverse Compilation Techniques by Cifuentes [...]
10) Do: Write a decompiler for CIL and/or Dalvik bytecode
11) Do: Write a decompiler for ARM (doesn't have to be ARM, but it's consistent and relatively sane)
12) Read: The osdev wiki, until your eyes can't focus anymore [...]
13) Do: Write a toy kernel
14a) Do: Write it again, with slightly less suck
14b) Do: Port your kernel to a different platform
15) Do: Pick a well-known platform and write an interpreting emulator
15a) Do: Add a recompiler [...]
16) Do: Pick a slightly-unknown platform
16a) Read: Everything you can find about it
16b) Do: Begin writing an emulator
16c) Read: All the assembly you can find, for bits that aren't known
16d) Go back to 16b, continuing your work [...]
